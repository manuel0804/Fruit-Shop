### Gui-Application Fruit-Shop
This was my first Gui-App created with Java Swing. 
It's an online shop where you can buy fruits. 
It contains the following functions:

1. Login
2. Add fruits to your cart
3. Remove articles from your cart
4. choosing a payment method and log in to it
5. writing your signature with the mouse
6. diffrent windows showing information about you and your current order
